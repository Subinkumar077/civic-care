# Fix User Registration Issues

## Problem
Users cannot sign up successfully because user profiles are not being created automatically after registration.

## Root Cause
The database has a `handle_new_user()` function but is missing the trigger that calls this function when new users sign up.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Run the Database Fix
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content of `comprehensive-signup-fix.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

This will:
- ✅ Create the missing trigger for automatic profile creation
- ✅ Fix RLS policies for user profiles
- ✅ Create profiles for any existing users who don't have them
- ✅ Add proper error handling

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. Open your application in the browser
2. Try to sign up as a new user
3. Check the browser console for any errors
4. Verify that you can log in after signup

### Step 3: Optional - Run Test Script
1. Open browser console on your app
2. Copy and paste the content of `test-signup-process.js`
3. Run it to automatically test the signup process

## What the Fix Does

### Database Changes:
- Creates a trigger `on_auth_user_created` that runs when users sign up
- Fixes RLS policies to allow profile creation
- Adds error handling to prevent signup failures
- Creates profiles for existing users

### User Flow After Fix:
1. User fills out signup form
2. Supabase creates auth user
3. Trigger automatically creates user profile
4. User can immediately log in and use the app

## Verification

After running the fix, you should see:
- ✅ New users can sign up successfully
- ✅ User profiles are created automatically
- ✅ Users can log in immediately after signup
- ✅ No console errors during signup process

## Troubleshooting

If signup still doesn't work:

1. **Check Supabase Project Status**
   - Ensure your Supabase project is not paused
   - Check if you have database quota remaining

2. **Check RLS Policies**
   - Verify that RLS policies allow profile creation
   - Check if service role has proper permissions

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Check network tab for failed API calls

4. **Test with Different Email**
   - Try with a completely new email address
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
