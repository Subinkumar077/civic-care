## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Toast Not Showing
- **Cause**: ToastProvider not properly wrapped
- **Fix**: Ensure Routes.jsx has ToastProvider wrapper

### WhatsApp Not Sent
- **Cause**: Missing environment variables
- **Fix**: Check .env file and restart server
- **Cause**: Invalid phone number format
- **Fix**: Ensure phone starts with country code (+91)

### Issue Creation Fails
- **Cause**: RLS policy blocking creation
- **Fix**: Run `fix-issue-creation-rls.sql`
- **Cause**: Missing required fields
- **Fix**: Ensure all form validation passes

### Phone Number Missing
- **Cause**: User signed up without phone
