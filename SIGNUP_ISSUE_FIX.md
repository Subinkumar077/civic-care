# Fix Signup Redirection Issue

## Problem Analysis
After clicking "Create Account", users are redirected to the login page with an "Invalid email or password" error. This suggests:

1. **User account creation might be failing silently**
2. **Email confirmation might be required but not handled**
3. **User profile creation might be failing**
4. **Automatic sign-in after signup is failing**

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Database Trigger
The user profile creation trigger might not exist, causing profile creation to fail.

### 2. Email Confirmation Settings
Supabase might require email confirmation, preventing immediate login.

### 3. RLS Policy Issues
Row Level Security policies might prevent profile creation.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Fix
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Run the `comprehensive-signup-fix.sql` script
3. This creates the missing trigger and fixes RLS policies

### Step 2: Check Email Confirmation Settings
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. Look for "Enable email confirmations"
3. **Recommended**: Disable email confirmations for easier testing
4. Or handle email confirmation properly in the app

### Step 3: Test the Debug Script
1. Open browser console on your app
2. Run the `debug-signup-issue.js` script
3. This will test the entire signup flow and identify issues

### Step 4: Verify the Fix
1. Try signing up with a new email
2. Check browser console for detailed logs
3. User should be automatically signed in and redirected based on role

## Updated Signup Flow

### For Citizens:
1. Fill signup form → Click "Create Account"
2. Account created → Auto sign-in → Redirect to `/public-landing-page`

### For Admins/Department Managers:
1. Fill signup form → Select "Department Manager" role → Click "Create Account"  
2. Account created → Auto sign-in → Redirect to `/admin-dashboard`

## Troubleshooting

### If signup still fails:

1. **Check Supabase Project Status**
   - Ensure project is not paused
   - Check database quota

2. **Check Email Confirmation**
   - Disable in Supabase settings for testing
   - Or implement proper email confirmation flow

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for detailed error logs
   - Check network tab for failed requests

4. **Check Database**
   - Verify user_profiles table exists
   - Check if trigger is created
   - Verify RLS policies

### Common Error Messages:

- **"Invalid email or password"** → User profile not created or email confirmation required
- **"User already registered"** → Email already exists, try different email
- **"Failed to fetch"** → Supabase project paused or network issue
- **"Cannot connect to authentication service"** → Supabase configuration issue
